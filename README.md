# google_material_icons_tools
Just some things I used when building tools for dynamic saving, setting, or loading icons.
I will update when I can and anyone can contribute. I really just want to expand on google's icons and usability. 
Likely will build in something later that auto-gens selections for internal tools or blogs, whatever it may be :)
